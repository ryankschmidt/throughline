/**
 * ThroughLine operator profile: the settings Ryan has decided, declared once in code so a new
 * install, a new host or a cut from upstream starts with them instead of with upstream's
 * defaults. The server layers these entries over upstream defaults and over settings.json every
 * time settings load, and writes `<stateDir>/operator-profile-receipt.json` saying what applied,
 * what a deliberate local override kept, and what was rejected and why
 * (apps/server/src/throughline/operatorProfile/).
 *
 * Rules for entries:
 * - `key` is a server settings key, so a key upstream renames or removes fails the build.
 * - `value` is the settings-file form. `{home}` stands for the host's home folder.
 * - `merge: "deep"` sets only the fields named in `value` and keeps the rest of the stored value
 *   (used for provider instances, whose credentials and model lists this profile does not own).
 * - No model ids and no secret values. Keys owned elsewhere are named in
 *   OPERATOR_PROFILE_NOT_OWNED, with their owner.
 * - `protected` entries are also checked by the ship pipeline against
 *   vault/01_Projects/workbench/infra/throughline/contracts/Protected-Settings.json.
 *
 * Keep this file free of runtime imports: the ship pipeline's protected-settings checker loads
 * it directly with node.
