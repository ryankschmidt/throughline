// its canonical form fail. Node reads TEMP/TMP on every os.tmpdir() call, so
// pointing them at the long form fixes every temp directory the suite makes.
// macOS likewise exposes /var through a symlink to /private/var. Resolve the
// fixture root before creating paths that production code compares to realpath.
