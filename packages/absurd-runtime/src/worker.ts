/**
 * Reusable worker starter for the absurd-runtime overlay capability module.
 *
 * This is the seam the backend server (apps/server) would call to launch the
 * Absurd worker as part of its boot. It is intentionally tiny and side-effect
 * free until invoked: construct an `Absurd` app bound to a queue, register the
 * durable task, and start the polling worker.
 *
 * Connection comes from ABSURD_DATABASE_URL in the environment (the SDK reads
 * it). The caller owns process lifecycle; `startWorker` polls forever, so it is
 * NOT awaited here (matches absurd-sandbox/src/demo.ts).
