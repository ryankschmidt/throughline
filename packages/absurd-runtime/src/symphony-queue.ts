/**
 * symphony-queue (Slice 1S — design: Slice-1S-Session-Boundary-Design.md,
 * symphony-typescript-port).
 *
 * Dedicated queue for symphony campaign `t3.thread-run` spawns, isolated from
 * the interactive turn rail (`t3-interactive-turns`, concurrency 16). The
 * module's secret is the same one agent-queue.ts owns: QUEUE TOPOLOGY is what
 * makes a campaign fan-out structurally incapable of starving Ryan's live
 * interactive turns, instead of merely being policed by a runtime readiness
 * check after the fact.
 *
 * D7 (cross-queue join rule, verbatim from the design doc): the SDK requires
 * `ctx.awaitTaskResult` to target a DIFFERENT queue than the caller's
 * (same-queue joins can deadlock worker slots — documented in agent-queue.ts's
 * header). `t3.thread-run` is a leaf task (no awaits), so `t3-symphony` is
 * safe. If the campaign later adds parent orchestrator tasks that await
 * children, parents must NOT share `t3-symphony` with the children they
 * await — put parents on `t3-interactive-turns` or a third queue.
 *
 * Must NOT own: provider dispatch, UI rendering, checkpoint storage (the
 * checkpoint-bridge owns that), or readiness computation (runtimeReadiness.ts
 * owns the probe that reads this queue's reachability; this module only
 * starts/stops the worker).
