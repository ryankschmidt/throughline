      "For each provider (Claude through the mod, Codex through its approval policy and CLI, Pi through the wrapped loop) and each operation class (pre-model admission, pre-tool veto, post-tool observation, cancellation, compaction, native resume, model routing through the access broker), the matrix states supported, observe-only or unsupported, with the hook or policy that proves it. An unsupported enforcement class is refused for that provider or declared observational; parity is never invented. The matrix is measured under the real launch policy before the binding slice is called done, and re-measured at every provider version pin. The operation-class matrix carries one more row per provider: headroom read, satisfied by the access broker's credential-free observer (never by an agent-side counter), with the observed reset time and freshness; a provider route that cannot read headroom is marked observe-only for that row, never blocked. The execution cells of the device matrix are owned per provider: the Claude binding (T8.01), the Codex binding (T11.02) and the Pi binding (T11.01); the model route (T11.03) owns only the claim that the picker shows the model that answers. Shell is two cells, never one: shell start (pre-veto supported where the provider's hook fires before the command, counted) and live shell input (write_stdin, persistent shell input, hosted or specialized tool paths that bypass hooks), which is unsupported for pre-veto on every provider and is bound at the effect instead. Every shell session is an effect attempt (K01) with outcome unknown until the writes it produced are reconciled from the host's record of changed paths; safety is never inferred from the working directory or from the approval that started the session. A thread whose check-first is pending cannot be computed done while a shell session it started is open or carries unreconciled writes (K08, K10). The enforced live-shell cell exists only through the controlled executor of T3.06, a client of the one admission service; until T3.06 ships the cell reads observe-only, and no report calls live shell input gated. Model-request admission is a separate operation class from turn admission. Its enforced mechanism on every provider is the access-broker route: a request is forwarded only with an admission token minted by the one admission service for the thread, turn and execution generation (K04), verified by the broker on each request, and refused without it or with a stale generation; auxiliary and plugin-originated model calls carry the same token because they use the same route. Provider-side hooks for model requests are observe-and-annotate only and are never counted as the gate. A host where model traffic can reach a provider without the broker route is not an execution host (K05). A matrix cell counts as bound only when the action carries a step id minted before execution and its outcome is written to that step; a cell whose binding is observation after the fact reads observe-only and never satisfies NG-035, NG-036 or NG-038, and a device cell of the execution row passes only when every operation class a bound seat can reach is bound or unavailable to that seat.",

The launcher and supervisor exist on every Linux execution host, each with its own installed identity receipt and provider receipt; a host without its own receipts has no launched seats, and a tower receipt never stands for the Raspberry Pi.

The existing ThroughLine pairing transport is the adapter to the one admission service on the tower; the HTTP-and-SSE hub is adopted only if it supplies a transport function pairing lacks. When the tower record is unreachable: no new durable execution anywhere, cached history shown as stale, drafts kept as unsubmitted, no Mac scheduler and no Mac database. On lease loss an executor stops new effects, records unknown outcomes and resumes only from the same authority. Without Tailscale, the preserved route is the Cloudflare tunnel to the tower service (the path Ryan requested) or a replacement he authorizes; it reaches the same admission service, never a fallback authority. The Mac keeps no Postgres credential an agent can read: the app-only keychain entry is proven by a test that a Mac-local agent cannot read it. Permission to execute a model-backed turn consults the broker's observed headroom: unknown or stale never blocks, known-empty is not retried until the observer reports a reset, and the waiting request stays a wait row; no cap, quota or per-consumer meter exists anywhere in ThroughLine, which the Sep 30 no-limits ruling forbids. Pairing and its renewal are performed by the adapter or launcher from a credential the access broker holds; a client whose login expired is re-paired without Ryan typing a token; operator-reserved acts are derived from current owning platform contracts and actual capabilities, each with cited Ryan authority and its alternative; an agent-capable tap stays agent-owned. Retire the Mac database service only after T4.03’s non-builder keep-alive and independent Raspberry Pi loss/notification receipts all pass with laptop closed and tower unavailable; both observer delivery and notify.push/grant are required prerequisites. The Raspberry Pi observer writes its own status/loss record locally and uses the local broker-service capability and phone route over LAN, never tower admission or a tower proxy; no lost tower record is needed to report its own outage. The Mac habitat job is only a second transition observer; Health Hub and x-registry are retired and never acceptance evidence. Injected crashes recover by the actual unit policy on disposable rehearsal; intentional maintenance stops stay down, are reported and restore explicitly. No shared live-database fault probe. The tower passes through three declared states and no surface may claim more than the current one. Before T4.06: shared-account, the twr account owns the record, its unit and its server role credential, and any twr seat can stop or alter them; nothing about binding, isolation or custody is claimable. After T4.06 and before T6.02: record-isolated-seats-shared, the record and the server run as their own locked service accounts under system units, the credential is root-owned and loaded only into the server unit, so no twr seat can stop the record or read the credential, and credential custody on the tower is claimable; but seats still share the twr account with each other and with the human account, have no execution generation, and can read one another's files, so agent binding and seat isolation are not claimable; the Mac cutover (T4.02) may run in this state because the record it targets is already outside the seats' reach, and the Mac path stays restorable until Phase 6. After T6.02: authority-isolated, reached only by the T6.02 receipt that shows no harness process owned by twr and the K04 reach test passing; every claim is then available. Permission to execute protected effects is a launch property: a seat launched for a thread with check-first pending runs with the protected roots read-only at the OS level, and the transition to build-allowed is a relaunch with a new execution generation (K04); detection after a write never substitutes for this. During a cutover the fenced source is not a second authority: its admission refuses, its worker holds no lease, and after the switch the fence is permanent; the Raspberry Pi general-record cutover is deferred under IC-008; the bounded recovery island described below is never merged and is not a second authority for ThroughLine work. The supervisor registry is written only by root on its host and read by that host's server; it is attestation of membership, not an authority to execute, and it reaches the admission service only over the host's existing authenticated record connection. Loss of the tower record is answered by a deterministic ladder and then by a responder agent on the always-on Raspberry Pi, launched through the local broker's wake capability as a visible thread on the Raspberry Pi's own ThroughLine server with model access through the Raspberry Pi's own provider broker, never through the tower; Ryan receives information at open and close and is paged, with exactly one act named, only when no responder can be launched or reached, when the responder exhausts its authority, or when the host is unreachable; one incident per target, one responder at a time, no reboot by any agent without Ryan's yes. The tower's disk is encrypted and unlocked only by Ryan at the KVM after a reboot; no agent reboots the tower without his yes in the current conversation; reboot-survival on the tower is proven by bootout-and-bootstrap of units, never by a reboot; an unreachable tower is classified as planned-reboot-waiting-for-unlock or unreachable-unplanned, both stop repair and page Ryan with the one act, and neither is reported as broken. One bounded exception exists and is owned by T12.08: while an incident is open on the Raspberry Pi watcher's ledger, the Raspberry Pi's own ThroughLine server and its local record form the recovery island, which admits exactly one thread kind, the responder, whose effects are limited to the responder authority list and whose every step is appended to the tower record as events when the record returns; the island admits nothing for the one record, is never merged into it, admits nothing outside an open incident, and is not an execution authority for ThroughLine work; a responder step that needs the tower record is recorded unknown and surfaced, never executed on the island.",

The target-promotion threshold starts at 0.80 as an unevaluated parameter and governs only after the calibration test below; no quota is invented. Placement (NG-087, NG-088, NG-089): the same port is bound at level 6 to the tool inputs, tool results and outgoing model requests the provider adapters intercept (the Claude mod, the Codex native hooks and approvals, the Pi admission extension), at level 7 to turn ends (unfinished work, clarification, target change), and to ComsNet socket sends and replies (T7.03); never to stock-provider activity observed afterwards. Every call and answer is an Absurd step on the request's own workflow carrying source ids, question version, model and confidence, so a retry reads the recorded answer instead of calling again. JEV classifies and annotates; code decides. The route slot of the admission decision (D25, T3.08) is a named consumer of this port: its conditions (needs_new_work, notice_only, asks_recorded_fact, asks_judgment, names_deliverable, bounded_spans) are asked in one batched call over the single admitted message, cached by content hash plus the recipient's generation, so a broadcast to many recipients is classified once. The answers annotate the route decision; the floor-file policy decides; a no-answer, timeout or refusal leaves the code rules and the standard route in force. The calibration corpus of T9.04 includes the wake messages of the Oct 10, 2026 audit (coordination notices, lead rulings, operator liveness questions) labelled by a non-builder.",

At target admission the admitted target carries the shape ids its first acts match, resolved the same way; the agent's tools to fix a target may add or remove a shape with the change recorded as an event. Building is decided by code from engine-typed facts: an effect whose kind writes, patches, executes, installs or releases inside the admitted target's declared scope or a registered product root; marking done is a done-claim or acceptance effect; both are refused per effect, not per turn, until the failing check is recorded; an opaque effect that could touch that scope runs only through an enforced read-only or test path or is refused with a usable alternative; post-tool detection is never counted as prevention; no caller-supplied label changes the classification.
