    serves: ["NG-007", "NG-112", "NG-027"],
    what: "Add the turn-admission module at apps/server/src/throughline/admission/ (fork namespace). CommandAdmission.ts defines TURN_EFFECT_COMMAND_TYPES = [\"thread.turn.start\", \"thread.user-input.respond\"] (the only decider cases that can start a provider turn, guarded by S3-G05), the six routes client-ws, client-http, comsnet, history-import, absurd-worker and server-reissue, the marker throughline.admission.v1 (logged at boot so the bundle keeps it), and the service CommandAdmission with admit, dispatch and startTurn. Provenance is object identity: admit() registers the command object in a module-private WeakSet and returns an AdmittedCommand; no serializable field can forge it (K01). Route rules: history-import admits thread.history.import and refuses thread.turn.start; server-reissue requires causationCommandId of an already admitted turn; client-ws, client-http, comsnet and absurd-worker admit both turn-effect types. EngineAdmissionGuard.ts decorates OrchestrationEngineService.dispatch and refuses an unadmitted turn-effect command with a typed error; other command types pass unchanged. TurnRail.ts takes spawnTurnOnAbsurdRail and its readiness gate out of ws.ts unchanged, keeping the Exclude-typed direct arm (S3-G01). Doors (E08-E14): ws.ts calls CommandAdmission.dispatch; http.ts stays unchanged, and a thread.turn.start sent through its handler reaches the engine unadmitted and is refused by the mounted EngineAdmissionGuard; comsnet dispatches through admission with route comsnet, a stable message id comsnet:<requestId>, and ComsNetRedrive.ts re-drives at boot any request marked dispatched whose turn-start event is absent, deduplicated by the stable command id (S3-G02); the reactor's after-compaction re-issue is admitted with route server-reissue; user-input answers are admitted with route client-ws and dispatched to the engine (their nested turn becomes durable through the outbox in T3.03). History import (operator intent from the refinement: never replay old actions, never manufacture new admission for old work): the command-line importer writes thread.history.import with the message shape AgentSessionImporter.ts builds (E13) through the offline engine with route history-import, emits no turn-start event and no effect, and its live-server guard probes the port the selected profile's server is configured to use; the outside resume tool stops writing orchestration_events, projection_threads and provider_session_runtime rows and calls the importer instead. Admit accepts optional intent references (vocabulary.intent_metadata_carriage) and keeps them on the AdmittedCommand; T3.03 persists them. The turn-rail capability manifest with the new pinned tests goes under docs/throughline/capabilities/turn-rail/. Effect admission and K08 check-first (generation 3, Oct 9, 2026): the same module exposes admitEffect for per-effect requests from the provider adapters (interface I-01). classifyEffect builds and brands the request server-side and resolves its paths; an unbranded request is refused. Only the target-policy slot (T9.03) decides whether an effect is building or marking done, from engine-typed facts; T3.01 combines that answer with the K03 enforcement matrix, read as measured data, and records every decision with its inputs. Rules T3.01 enforces: (1) Prevention happens only before execution. A post-tool observation is recorded as observed-after-execution with prevented false; a building effect observed while check-first is pending is a recorded violation that stops the request and surfaces it, never counted as prevented. (2) An opaque effect whose write set the adapter cannot resolve before execution (shell, terminal input, an unknown tool call) is never admitted on its cwd. While check-first is pending, or with no target revision when it can reach protected product scope, it runs only under a read-only or design-and-test-writable mode that the K03 matrix measures as supported for that provider and host, or it is refused with a usable safe alternative named in the decision: run it under the enforced mode, write a design note, record the failing check first, or dispatch to a seat whose target has one. (3) No target revision is not permission. The default slot classifies engine-resolved paths against ProtectedScopeSlot (the bound product repository roots and the install and release step ids): writes inside, install steps and release steps are refused with the safe alternative 'admit a target and record its failing check'; writes outside, such as designs and scratch, are admitted, which is K08's own no-target test. (4) The test path stays open: writes to the target revision's declared check files and running its declared check command are admitted before the failing check is recorded. (5) Turn starts, seat launches, dispatches, reads and design writes are admitted in every state. A turn on a provider with no measured pre-execution control is admitted with enforcement none and preventable false recorded; its building effects are refused where the adapter sees them first and otherwise become violations; nothing is advertised as enforced that K03 has not measured. Caller fields such as exploration, mode, skip_gate or a file name never change an outcome; they are listed as ignoredCallerFields. The admission decorator admits shell starts as effect attempts with outcome unknown; live shell input is not admitted per keystroke and is never claimed gated; the thread's effect ledger receives the host's observed changed-path record for each open shell session, and the done computation reads it (K08). The decorator mounts once at the engine assembly point already edited by the fork; no new stock-file edit; the HTTP dispatch door is closed by that refusal; the comsnet door's retirement and its three fork-file removal proofs belong to T7.04. Route slot (D25): admit() for the turn-effect command types and the comsnet route evaluates a route slot before dispatch, in the same transaction as the admission decision; the decision row records route (no_model | light | standard | lead_only), the pass that decided it (code | jev | default), the code facts used, the JEV step id when one exists, and the floor-file version. no_model dispatches no turn: the command is admitted, the event is recorded, a record-built reply is enqueued on the rail when the sender expects one, and the recipient's pending digest gains one entry. light, standard and lead_only dispatch a turn carrying the route so the provider adapter launches or resumes the recipient at the routed model and effort; a route the adapter cannot honour (no such model on this host) falls back to standard and records the fallback. The slot is a policy input exactly as the headroom slot (T11.04) and the target-policy slot (T9.03) are; it never changes a seat's launch setting and never edits the floor file.",

    what: "Build the record and the request workflow as a library with tests; T3.03 mounts it. New package packages/throughline-record (@throughline/record; it never imports server code, the same direction rule as absurd-runtime). Its migration creates schema throughline_record in the existing absurd database with seven tables: admitted_commands (command_id primary key, command_type, aggregate_kind, aggregate_id, route, admitted_at, origin, intent, causation_command_id, payload), events (the orchestration_events columns of E19, payload and metadata as jsonb, unique(stream_id, stream_version), command_id referencing admitted_commands), effect_attempts (effect_id, attempt, command_id, effect_kind, lease_owner, execution_generation, started_at, finished_at, outcome succeeded | failed | unknown, idempotent, detail; primary key effect_id and attempt), outbox (effect_id, command_id, effect_kind, request_id, generation, state pending | spawned | done, absurd_task_id), projection_cursors (consumer, last_sequence), admission_decisions (decision_id, command_id or effect_id, outcome, reason_code, policy_inputs_used, ignored_caller_fields, decided_at; written in the same transaction as the admitted row so a judge can replay a decision) and blobs (blob_id as sha256, size_bytes, media_type, custody, retention, bytes). RecordPort.appendAdmitted writes the command row, its events and their outbox rows in one transaction and is idempotent on command_id. An outbox row exists for every thread.turn-start-requested event (provider-turn effect); a settings-change command (alignment entry IA-04, NG-114) is admitted and recorded with events and no outbox row. beginEffect claims an attempt under a lease; an attempt whose lease expired without an outcome becomes unknown; a non-idempotent unknown stops its request and surfaces it, never retried silently (K01). Request workflow throughline.request (K02): one Absurd 0.5.0 run per admitted turn, with one step per managed model request, tool start and provider callback, the step id minted by I-01 before the action and carried by it, keyed request id (the admitted command id) and generation, steps ensure-started (claims the effect; starts the provider only if no attempt exists) then await-terminal (Absurd 0.5.0 durable event turn-terminal:<requestId>:<generation>, holding no worker slot), with ACK, progress, reply, terminal result and verified completion kept as distinct states, and a late or duplicate reply to a closed generation recorded and ignored. One recorded step per finished message: every finished assistant message is one event with its own effect id, so a crash mid-turn resumes after the last finished message. Tool results over the step payload limit are stored in blobs and the event carries the blob id; the limit is read from Absurd 0.5.0 or, if undocumented, set to the largest payload the record test proves stores and reloads, recorded as a named constant. The in-process transport derives created thread ids and command ids from the task id and step name (E16); the symphony campaign task t3.thread-run stays, now idempotent. Evidence pointer (D25): a tool result stored in blobs is addressable by the model through one read-back operation on the record, readBlob(blob_id, byte_range) -> bytes, so a provider adapter may hand the model an evidence summary with the blob id instead of the raw result and the model can still recover any original passage.",

RecordFirstTransactionClient.ts is the SqlClient handed to the engine only: withTransaction opens the SQLite transaction, then the Postgres transaction inside it, so Postgres commits first; a SQLite failure after that leaves the screen store behind, and the projection pipeline catches up from projection_state by cursor. runtimeLayer.ts provides both to the engine in place of OrchestrationEventStoreLive and the receipt repository. OutboxDispatcher.ts spawns throughline.request for pending outbox rows; the reactor claims the provider-turn effect through RecordPort.beginEffect before sendTurn (one mount line at the sendTurn call), so the live path and the workflow's ensure-started never both start a turn. Before the server first boots on the record, scripts/throughline/backfill-record.ts copies every existing orchestration_events row and command receipt from a VACUUM INTO snapshot of state.sqlite into the record with the same event ids, stream versions and order, and verifies per-stream counts and hashes; if verification fails the mount is not switched and the server keeps SQLite (no history loss). scripts/throughline/check-record-coverage.ts proves every projected message has its event and every finished turn its effect outcome. Absurd down: a new turn is refused with turn rail not ready: queue-reachability, drafts stay unsubmitted, history reads from the screen store marked stale (K05).

    detail_state: "detailed",
    what: "Keep-alive: the record at 100.96.34.116:5432, probed by address; the unit that owns that port is state-dependent: absurd-pg.service (twr user unit) in state shared-account, throughline-record.service (system unit, account throughline-record) from state record-isolated-seats-shared onward; the keep-alive proof runs on the rehearsal cluster in whichever state is current and asserts Restart=always on the unit that owns the port at check time. Off-host detection: a user unit and 60-second timer under the rpi account on the Raspberry Pi (Linger=yes, always on, independent of the Mac and of the tower) runs a credential-free liveness probe against 100.96.34.116:5432 (TCP connect plus Postgres startup handshake with TLS, the pg_isready shape; no role, no password) and writes a durable status row to /home/rpi/.local/state/absurd-record-watch/status.json plus an append-only loss log. Operator notification: when a loss persists for two consecutive cycles outside a declared maintenance window, the observer asks the Raspberry Pi's own admin-capability-broker (broker-capability.service, account broker-service, a system unit on the Raspberry Pi that holds credentials under root-owned custody and serves typed capabilities over a Unix socket to the rpi group) to push one line to the existing ntfy.sh phone topic Ryan already receives alerts on; recovery pushes one line. That route depends on nothing on the tower and nothing on the Mac: measured 2026-10-09 from the rpi account, ntfy.sh resolves to a public address and is reached through the LAN default gateway 192.168.0.1 on eth0 with no Tailscale exit node, not through the tailnet. A forwarder to the tower broker (broker-tower-tunnel.service) is explicitly not the route, because it dies with the tower. The push capability does not exist in the broker's registry yet; it is a required prerequisite with a named owner and first action (open_dependencies below), so until it is installed the notification cell reads DEPENDENCY-OPEN and is never reported as accepted. The Mac habitat supervisor is a second observer kept only as a transition mechanism; the Health Hub adapter it reports to is retired by SHAPE-2026-09-03 line 28 and counts for nothing in acceptance; it is not the laptop-closed witness. Final visibility is the ThroughLine durability view that T12.01 builds (which shows the Raspberry Pi observer's heartbeat row and its age) plus the Raspberry Pi notification path when the tower or its record is down. Independence from the admission path: the observer writes its loss row to the Raspberry Pi's own disk, calls the Raspberry Pi broker over a local Unix socket, and the broker publishes to ntfy.sh over the LAN; no ThroughLine turn, Absurd task, event or admitted command is involved anywhere in that chain, so the report reaches Ryan while the tower record is the thing that is down. No seat reports the tower record healthy from the tower's own say-so: a health claim cites the Raspberry Pi status row or the durability view's rendering of it. Restart/timer values are read from effective installed configuration; a fast restart alone does not promise a sampled loss. T4.04 and T4.05 receipts are required before cutover; notification is never conditional PASS. Runtime loss testing uses a sustained controlled rehearsal fault through the real consumer, not a shared live-database kill. On a confirmed loss the watcher opens an incident file in /home/rpi/.local/state/absurd-record-watch/incidents/<id>.json with responder=not-installed and sends one informational line through notify.push reading 'no responder installed yet; no action needed unless paged'; T12.08 later consumes the same incident file and owns tier 0, tier 1, their ordering before further lines, and the page.",

    what: "One ThroughLine Claude mod in the fork namespace, loaded in every Claude session the launcher starts. Its hooks turn each model request and tool call into an I-01 admission request over the server's local socket and act on the decision: pre-tool refused means the tool does not run; unreachable admission means refuse (fail-closed). A mod handler that throws, overruns its budget or returns an invalid value falls through to the core by default, and a deny after await next is too late (G6 B03), so the mod obtains a validated decision before it calls next, returns a valid refusal on any error, installs a refusing catch on tool.call and turn.step, and writes a load witness so a missing mod is never counted as enforced. Agent spawn is vetoed before the spawn (SubagentStart only observes) and a cancellation is recorded as stop-requested until it settles; a post-tool event or an interrupt is never counted as prevented (G6 B06). Classes the hooks cannot veto are declared observe-only in the K03 row, never claimed. The mod never classifies an effect and never signs provenance. It carries the four coms tools over I-05. Target tools move to T8.03. No journal: every row goes through the server door, never to Postgres. Levels 6 and 7 of JEV (NG-087, NG-089): the mod passes each intercepted tool input, tool result and outgoing model request, and each turn end, to the K07 port; each answer is a recorded step with source ids, question version, model and confidence, and annotates without admitting or refusing. The mod's turn.step remains a pre-model check for the turn's own requests (supported, counted) and fails closed per B03; auxiliary and plugin-originated model calls are observed by the mod and enforced only by the broker token; the launcher-passed admission token is attached to every outbound model request. The mod attaches the step id to each tool.call and model request it observes; an action with no step id is refused by the mod (B03 fail-closed) and, independently, at the broker. Evidence instead of raw output (D25, level 6): before a tool result enters the model's context the mod's tool.result hook sends the full result to the record (blob when over the step payload limit, T3.02) and asks the admission service for evidence: code facts (exit code, byte and line counts, changed paths, diff stats, the first and last lines) and, when the K07 port is bound, the passages JEV selects against the tool call's stated purpose and the bounded questions the call carried; the model receives the evidence with the blob id and recovers any original passage through readBlob. Whether the Claude mod can replace a tool result before the model sees it is measured in the K03 row, never assumed; where it cannot, the row says observe-only and the raw result enters context.",

The packet names the committed sequence cut, target revision, execution generation, native-session handle and unresolved-effect set; release is an atomic compare-and-release against the current cut, so a stale packet never releases (K06).

There is one Codex provider and no separate worker lane.

A declined candidate leaves the thread exploring; JEV re-asks only when the thread's own text changes. Code admits; JEV never does. An admitted target carries the shape ids its first acts match; the add, fix and retract tools record shape changes as events (delta IA-02). The port lives in its own package (D-CAP-09). NG-090: the port keeps a registry of its consumers so each new JEV use is visible and kept once a consumer uses its answer; the daily cadence is an operating practice after install, not an install gate. Placement accepted by the integration decision: packages/throughline-conditions is a code package only. No new daemon, queue, policy store or credential client; it reuses the existing broker capability and its owning client contract, and targets, re-entry and delivery consume the port without importing one another. After a target is admitted (NG-078), every later message is evaluated automatically with a typed outcome, unchanged, replaces the target, constrains it, or a separate task, and each change is a revision event that keeps the old words and the reason. The route slot (T3.08) is a registered consumer of the port (NG-090) through T9.06; its conditions are batched in one call per admitted message and cached by content hash plus recipient generation, so a broadcast is one call.",

The admission point (T3.01) makes the decision and refuses that effect, never the turn. K08's scope is kept whole: building and marking done wait for the failing check; launching seats, writing designs, dispatching and exploration do not. Settled by the integration decision. The building obligation is K08's verbatim: building and marking done wait for the failing check; launching seats, writing designs, dispatching and exploration do not. Classification uses engine-typed facts only (effect kind set by the server-side adapter, engine-resolved paths and cwd, step id, record state); a caller field such as exploration, mode or skip_gate is ignored and recorded. The deliverable scope is the admitted target revision's declared scope, plus the registered product roots (the fork repository, install roots and release steps) so that the absence of a target never grants unverified product mutation; design and plan areas outside those roots are never building. Post-tool observation is never counted as prevention. When an opaque command, such as a shell command whose writes cannot be resolved before it runs, could touch that scope, it runs only through an enforced read-only or test execution path, or that one effect is refused with a usable safe alternative named in the refusal; the turn stays available. Where K03 measures pre-tool veto as unsupported for a provider launch, that launch is refused for gated building explicitly and is never advertised as enforced.

ThroughLine keeps spawning Pi in RPC mode through the governed ryan-pi door (A16). Pi already forwards its own session id on every model call of a session (A54); ThroughLine cannot choose that id, so the stable cache key is the Pi session id bound one-to-one to the conversation, recorded as a native alias under the conversation identity (T5.01), and every request workflow resumes that same Pi session (switch_session or the recorded session file) instead of opening a new one. Never a request id, a workflow id or a generation. NG-033: Claude reaching Pi through the Meridian route to the Agent SDK stays, checked as a retained protection. Binding (G6 B05): Pi in RPC mode has full tool access and no approval API, and heartbeats, workflow steps and resume do not veto a tool, so ThroughLine installs its admission extension in every Pi AgentSession loop on the native tool_call block, covering registered custom, MCP and dispatch tools, and classifies extension-owned process and file paths separately; no read-only Pi mode is advertised without a measured external sandbox; a retry keeps the native session file and id. The Pi adapter has no native compaction control today; Pi compaction stays off through pi.compaction.enabled = false, owned by T10.10. Levels 6 and 7 of JEV (NG-087, NG-089) for Pi run on the inputs and results the admission extension intercepts and on each finished turn, through the same K07 port, as recorded steps. Pi's before_provider_request is observe-and-annotate; the durable Pi loop attaches the admission token to every provider request; a swallowed extension failure changes nothing, because the broker refuses an untokened request. The durable Pi loop checkpoints per managed action (a step per model request and per tool start), not per finished turn.

    what: "The adapter already maps each approval request to a typed kind (A19). Each becomes an I-01 admission request whose effect_kind comes from that typed kind; a refused decision declines the approval; an unreachable admission point declines (fail-closed). Under a launch policy that never asks for approval, approvals give no pre-tool veto (A20), but Codex native hooks do: hooks are stable and enabled on the Mac (Codex 0.161.0) and the tower (0.159.3) and support a scoped local-tool PreToolUse veto even under never (G6 B01). The binding therefore has two parts: approval requests for escalations, and a native PreToolUse hook bound to the same I-01 admission point, with mandatory loading and trust and a scoped coverage matrix in the K03 row. The Codex launch policy is not changed just to create approvals. The round-trip cost is measured, not assumed. There is one Codex provider; this task changes no seat's launch policy, and T10.10 removes the duplicate Codex provider entry (ryan-codex-worker) from ThroughLine's settings. Levels 6 and 7 of JEV (NG-087, NG-089) for Codex run on the inputs and results the native hooks and approval requests intercept and on each turn end, through the same K07 port, as recorded steps. Codex binds shell start through its native PreToolUse hook under the never approval policy (B01), counted; write_stdin and hosted or specialized tool paths are the live-input cell, observe-only, with their effects recorded from the host's changed-path record; the capability matrix row for Codex names both cells with their measured counts. Codex approvals never gate model requests; the Codex route carries the admission token the launcher passed, and the broker is the per-model gate. The Codex native PreToolUse hook attaches the step id to each tool start; a start with no step id is denied by the hook. Non-builder, installed Mac and tower: from a real codex seat add a candidate using source-bound Ryan words, read its exact words/revision/checks, fix it against the expected revision, read the new revision, retract it with reason and read the retraction event. Verify one admitted change/event per operation and the authenticated caller/generation. A stale revision or direct record write refuses. Calls delegate to the common target interface; no provider owns target state. The launcher binds this adapter on every initial and replacement launch. Evidence instead of raw output (D25, level 6) for Codex: the native hook that observes a tool result sends it to the record and requests evidence as T8.01 does; whether a Codex native hook can replace the result before the model reads it is measured in the K03 row (the Oct 10 audit shows Codex seats re-reading 40,000-character truncated results on every later step); where it cannot, the row says observe-only and the adapter's only lever is the route slot and wake coalescing.",

    what: "Install the release on the Mac, tower, iPhone and Android phone from one commit; each target reads back the release and commit; one screenshot per upgrade; the cycle cheap enough for agents to iterate. This is one slice release; whole-design acceptance remains ACCEPT-ALL (K10, D21). Concretely: one new pipeline step, five-device-acceptance, in the existing release tool and its existing step contract (I-07, K12), appended after rewind-live-proof as the new final step and run by the close job that outlives the Mac app restart. It reads the expected candidate identity from the run's own {evidence}/source-commit.json (fields release and commit, the 40-character frozen source commit) and refuses before probing if run-binding.json names a different release. Each target then reports its own release and commit through one named readback (acceptance_interface.per_target_readback): the Mac and tower servers answer a new fork-namespace loopback route /.well-known/throughline/release from the build identity file the version-stamp step writes; the iPhone and Android apps report through the hello they send at connect (T3.05), recorded on the tower. Each target leaves one readback receipt and one screenshot; the step compares release and full commit per target, requires the active retained protection steps passed in the same run, and refuses with a named code on any mismatch, missing readback, missing or stale screenshot, or excluded verifier (acceptance_interface.refusals). Final architecture install also consumes T3.07: refuse unless the pinned upstream head is an ancestor of the installed source or every deliberate non-inclusion is source-backed and recorded. A preserve-base foundation release does not satisfy this gate. The existing five-device-acceptance identifier remains a compatibility name, not a five-device obligation: its required target set is the preserved admission snapshot amended only by IC-008. Raspberry Pi rows and rpi-cold-turn remain deferred, never passed.",

This is one slice release; whole-design acceptance remains ACCEPT-ALL (K10, D21). Concretely: one new pipeline step, five-device-acceptance, in the existing release tool and its existing step contract (I-07, K12), appended after rewind-live-proof as the new final step and run by the close job that outlives the Mac app restart. It reads the expected candidate identity from the run's own {evidence}/source-commit.json (fields release and commit, the 40-character frozen source commit) and refuses before probing if run-binding.json names a different release. Each target then reports its own release and commit through one named readback (acceptance_interface.per_target_readback): the Mac and tower servers answer a new fork-namespace loopback route /.well-known/throughline/release from the build identity file the version-stamp step writes; the iPhone and Android apps report through the hello they send at connect (T3.05), recorded on the tower. Each target leaves one readback receipt and one screenshot; the step compares release and full commit per target, requires the active retained protection steps passed in the same run, and refuses with a named code on any mismatch, missing readback, missing or stale screenshot, or excluded verifier (acceptance_interface.refusals). Final architecture install also consumes T3.07: refuse unless the pinned upstream head is an ancestor of the installed source or every deliberate non-inclusion is source-backed and recorded.

Tier 2 is Ryan, paged only when the responder cannot be launched (the wake is refused, the Raspberry Pi provider route is down, or the responder lease expires twice), when the responder exhausts its authority, or when the tower host is unreachable (item 3 decides the wording); the page states the exact act.

    what: "0.0.60 is the preserve-base foundation, not the completed architecture. Before any other Phase 4 task, fetch upstream T3 Code, pin its full commit and fetch time, enumerate every incoming commit and changed path from the prior merge base, and record adopt/retain/replace/defer with source-backed conflict decisions. Integrate the selected changes without losing fork capabilities. Every deliberate non-inclusion stays explicit; never describe that result as all updates included. Preserve the seam ceilings and run every pinned capability regression. The final install refuses without the same-candidate reconciliation receipt and ancestry or exhaustive deliberate-non-inclusion proof. Browser-preview screenshots are part of this acceptance: upstream commit ac8e9453ca0948469ccf5651b765086d8d9ecd64 replaces the native capturePage path with Page.captureScreenshot but is not a proven fix. After reconciliation, a non-builder runs every source-listed cold capture test on the built candidate and independently inspects failed-before and passing-after product screenshots. If upstream does not close it, reopen the same diagnosis with worker-shotdiag-db00e8d1 before final install.",

Code pass: sender class from the admitted command's origin (operator, agent, system notice, instrument); the T7.01 envelope kind (notice, acknowledgment, request, reply, result) and its structured no_reply flag; exact facts answered from the record (is thread X alive: last event time, generation, state; counts; ids); duplicate and superseded notices by content hash within the recipient's generation; hold-flag changes (send-hold lifted, quiet window ended) applied as state writes with no turn. Policy pass: a floor file contracts/Route-Policy.json (versioned, carried by T10.10's settings lane, editable only by Ryan on the Mac and twr) that maps (sender class, envelope kind, code facts, JEV conditions when present) to a route and names the light model from ryan model list; the default route is standard, which is today's behaviour. Wake coalescing: a recipient whose worker is not in a turn receives one turn per batch of pending tasks; the adapter resumes it once with a code-built digest (ids, kinds, record pointers, the operator's bytes for operator messages) and the superseded entries listed, never one turn per message. A notice routed no_model to a sleeping seat records an annotation and starts nothing. Reset re-check: when the broker observer reports an account's reset (T11.04), every queued message for a seat stopped by that limit is re-evaluated against current state before any wake; notices superseded by a later message, older than the recipient's generation cut, or already applied as state are recorded and excluded from the digest. The JEV pass is absent until T9.06 binds it; the slot's decided_by records code or default until then. An operator message routed no_model must carry a record-built reply or the slot escalates it to light; the operator's bytes are never rewritten.",
