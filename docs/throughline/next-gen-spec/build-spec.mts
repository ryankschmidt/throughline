    reason:
      "Current 0.4.27: S1-C14 no longer requires per-sample preparation event ids in the idle staging probe; all other sample fields, cadence, unchanged index bytes and live/non-builder bindings remain. The check directly reads the installed app.asar signatures and streamed server traces, refusing index-writing preparation spans overlapping the probe window (Ruling-S1-C14-Preparation-Event-20261011.txt items 1-4). Disposable fixtures cover the new bundle/trace failures and a passing idle probe without preparation ids; no app quit or restart. Prior 0.4.26: oldHomeAliasFindings applies the absent-alias final endpoint under --before-close, while ordinary moved still requires the alias to resolve to the repository and closed still refuses it (Ruling-T107-Close-Blockers-20261011.txt item 2); six disposable repository-move fixtures cover all states and both polarities; no other check changes. Prior 0.4.25 (0.4.24 was cancelled unmerged): S1-C13 reads the run's source identity through the release tool's admitted source-revision resolver (Ruling-Release-Closure-Contract.txt item 2): the effective commit binds the release worktree, every step and the closure's source_commit; the original commit equals source-commit.json, heads the admitted chain and is the closure's original_commit; the run id comes from run-binding.json and step bindings from each attempt's row, as the release tool writes them (both approved by the lead); the Raspberry Pi rule is unchanged; nine new release fixtures, including a real repair admitted by the release tool's own sourceRevision. Prior 0.4.23: worktree annotation contract gains the merged-and-retired row (T1.03, S1-C03): a folder named by a rebased row may be missing only with one final row bound to a hash-matching worktree-reclaim receipt that records its clean removal at the chain's last head, with that head merged into main; a rebased-row folder missing without it still refuses; folders named only by freeze or disposition rows stay governed by the existing move contract (lead ruling on review F1); ten new repository-move fixtures. Requested by worker-diskoff-1cb8d5ff for the five clean pushed folders the Oct 10 reclaim removed. Prior 0.4.22: apply Fable's JEV cost-router delta verbatim (execution/phase-05/Fable-Delta-JEV-Cost-Router.json, decision D25): a route slot inside the one admission decision (new task T3.08 in Phase 4, code-only rules, a policy floor file only Ryan edits, no wake on a notice, one wake per sleeping seat, reset re-check) and its JEV conditions behind K07 in Phase 5 (new task T9.06); appends to K07, T3.01, T3.02, T7.03, T8.01, T9.02, T9.04, T11.02 and T11.04. Prior 0.4.21: apply Fable's R3 verbatim for independent review F1-F3 of 0.4.20 (Review-Spec-0.4.20-8c4bf0d8fd.json): T4.07 reads environment names only through the source-owned env-names helper (authored by T4.05, contract and seven fixtures bound byte-equal by X21) and proves the Raspberry Pi provider route with a route-probe thread during its turn, depending on T4.04 and T4.05 and never on the T12.08 responder; T12.08 cites that receipt; T4.06 relocates the record TLS certificate and key to /etc/throughline/record-tls/ (root:throughline-record) in the same batch with rehearsal, old-home rejection under ProtectHome=yes and rollback; T4.01 states the two ssl_*_file lines that do not travel unchanged. Prior unlanded 0.4.20: bind B1 built-candidate browser-preview cold capture tests, mandatory failed-before/passing-after screenshot pair and same-diagnosis reopen before final install; no screenshot fix claimed. Prior unlanded 0.4.19: apply the final R2 state-scoped rehearsal probe and rehearsal-only twr grant; preserve production-unit isolation, before/after receipts and every prior fixture. Prior unlanded 0.4.18: apply Ryan instruction coverage IC-049/052/056/002/008: Phase 4 upstream reconciliation first, installed target-ID-only succession after provider adapters, one target API for Claude/Codex/Pi, command grammar and caller preservation, and Raspberry Pi pause with archive/watcher exceptions. Also incorporate R2 source follow-through. Prior unlanded 0.4.17: Apply corrected watcher/server/reboot design delta: locked server and record accounts, the Raspberry Pi responder recovery island and provider route, explicit tiered incidents, encrypted-disk reboot constraints and a non-install unlock proposal. Source decisions remain pinned; no runtime change is claimed. 0.4.16 was: Fixture path consolidation preserves every case inside the admitted slice-1 checker and removes the separate fixture paths without changing seam ceilings or the self-test. S1-C05 ports the approved deferred.rpi contract from frozen 0.4.12; S1-C13 follows the same explicit deferral instead of demanding a paused-device install receipt. T1.10 carries the original pause declaration; hardware and pipeline remain untouched. 0.4.15 was: Disposition proof correction for independent review F1 (Review-Spec-Archive-Readers-de292cef67.json): annotated and unannotated preserved entries share the same real-target existence, collection-containment and all-five-fingerprint proof. The failed head and its evidence remain preserved. 0.4.14 was: Reader-only repair: S1-C06 consumes archive annotations, pre-copy addenda and dropped third-party record rows; S1-C09 recognizes bound frozen-worktree dispositions and detached freezes and validates archive annotation shapes. Existing rebase custody and retained-link checks are unchanged; frozen witnesses stay read-only. 0.4.13 was: Three approved repository-spec changes, preserving the required old-home compatibility link while moved and its removal at closure: append-only reviewed rebase rows (including the prerequisite worktree annotation contract from the frozen 0.4.12 record); preserved release targets follow move annotations and archived staging links retain exact ledger proof; done_when commands preserve their intended folders. Repository baseline was 0.4.7; unrelated frozen-record amendments are not imported. 0.4.7 was: T1.05 record retention (execution/phase-03/delivery-2026-10-09/Move-Remainder-Receipt.json, question records-inside-build-output): each build container is archived whole with its frozen fingerprint; its records are first copied to retained-records under the evidence root with sanitized names and a manifest; S1-C06 checks no build-named directory, a passing ledger row per container, and every record at its new path with its SHA-256. 0.4.6 was: Rename on Ryan's direction: the vendored relay is @ryan/agent-mcp-relay at apps/server/vendor/agent-mcp-relay-0.3.0.tgz (was @ryan/coms-net at apps/server/vendor/ryan-coms-net-0.3.0-legacy-mcp-relay.tgz); T1.04 and T7.04, including the T7.04 gone-check, use the new names. 0.4.5 was: Release tool literal (execution/phase-03/Delivery-State.json): Ship Warden binds one payload per version, so T1.04 and S1-C05 accept throughline-ship 0.4.1 or later instead of 0.4.0. 0.4.4 was: Path correction (execution/phase-03/delivery-2026-10-09/Order-Coms-Net-Vendor.txt): the vendored relay tarball and its README live under apps/server/vendor/, where pnpm resolves file:vendor/...; every path in T1.04 and T7.04, including the T7.04 gone-check, now names apps/server/vendor/. 0.4.3 was: @ryan/coms-net (the legacy MCP relay, not ComsNet) is a frozen tarball in the repository, decision D3 (execution/phase-03/delivery-2026-10-09/D3-Coms-Net-Decision.json): T1.04 drops the rpi-coms-net.tar transfer and the tower coms-net presence check; T7.04 deletes the tarball, vendor/README.md and the dependency line and checks they are gone. 0.4.2 was: GitHub repository renamed ryankschmidt/t3code to ryankschmidt/throughline on Oct 9, 2026 under Ryan's order (execution/phase-03/repo-home-2026-10-09/Repo-Home-Receipt.json): origin and the publish-docs source_repository literal, R02 carried out, S1-C01 and S1-C09 accept the pre-rename frozen origin, S1-C04 and S1-C09 compare tags by target type, T1.04 records the Mac node 24.13.1 selection. 0.4.1 was: Exit-check corrections, Oct 9, 2026 (execution/phase-02/closeout-2026-10-09/P2-Exit-Check-0.4.0.json defects P2-01, P2-02, P2-03): T3.06 deferred outside the first-install graph on K03, the T10.04 edge removed and the first-install acceptance limited to live input unavailable on the Mac; T6.02 no longer waits on slice 13 and depends on T1.10, provider evidence stays with its owners; T3.01 refuses HTTP turn starts at the decorator through the unchanged http.ts with a behavioral test and checks non-increase against the real stock-file set. 0.4.0 was: Phase 2 close-out, Oct 9, 2026, single design writer (thread a96357c8): G2 five-target acceptance contract (T13.04, X20), G3 one Codex provider and no auto-compaction for Claude, Codex and Pi (T8.02, T10.10, T11.02), G4 map wording, G5 real starting state and release 0.0.60 (T1.01, T1.04, T1.10, fork_state), G6 provider enforcement folds, G1 second-look folds, and Fable-Delta-Enforcement.json and Fable-Delta-Hosts.json applied verbatim (new outline task T3.06); record in execution/phase-02/closeout-2026-10-09/Writer-Changes-0.4.0.json. 0.3.0 was: second pass, Oct 8, 2026: every item of the fidelity review (F01-F13), the architecture review (A01-A14), its addenda (A15-A18), the slice-1 judge round 2 and the overlapping shape-alignment items carries a disposition; seventeen cross-cutting contracts settle the consequential choices; every ledger item has a disposition; the five-device matrix, the decision source roles and the whole-design acceptance node are added; the checker gains closed enums and unique ids, the combined task-slice-precondition graph, a baseline non-increase and rendered-generation binding",
